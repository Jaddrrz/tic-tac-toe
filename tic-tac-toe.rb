# Find a way to choose where to put either cross or circle:
# - make a "tile" class where you put a circle/cross
# - find a way to put it in, maybe use positions like a1, b3, c2

#   - board class is used as a container for tiles, maybe use to manage sign choices
#   - line class check whether a player has won or not
